_Defy religion ... also written at the age of 14._

Let us ask ourselves, clay liars,

remain we true to our Promethean fires?

We idle, we watch, we hate, we blame -

Scoundrels, we love preaching virtues of shame.

Well, what's new, more rules for death?

Any tips to befriend remorse on our last breath?

We swing between each moral extreme,

gladly renouncing what is truly supreme. 

"A devout heart, and good strong will,

are the open windowsill.

Why wait for the unopened door,

when believing us gives you so much more?"

This is what heathen clerics divine,

But thy heart is only thine.
